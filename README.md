# Optimizer

GPU load balancer and optimizer script that can run in Google Colab. This script will monitor GPU usage, manage tasks, and optimize resource allocation in real-time.

Here are the key features:

Real-time GPU monitoring:

1. Tracks memory usage
2. Monitors GPU utilization
3. Collects performance metrics


Intelligent task scheduling:

1. Predicts resource requirements based on historical data
2. Assigns tasks to optimal GPUs
3. Handles task queuing when resources are constrained


Adaptive optimization:

1. Continuously monitors and adjusts resource allocation
2. Uses historical performance data to improve predictions
3. Handles task completion and resource freeing
